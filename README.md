# Discriminative Probabilistic Pattern Mining using Graph Convolutional Networks for Electronic Health Records

### Summary
This work proposes a new technique for classifying clinical notes in electronic health records (EHR). The technique uses a graph to represent the co-occurrence of binary features, such as keywords, that are discriminative for different groups of clinical notes. The graph is weighted by the log-odds score of each co-occurrence, which measures its discriminative power. 

This work uses Deep Learning and Data Mining to analyze electronic medical data and can be used to build preventative health platforms. Focused on disease prevention and management:
* Modeling disease progression and predict future risk for diseases (ex. pneumonia, sepsis, diabetes and mental health)
* Predicting unplanned re-admissions
* Early warning system to predict diseases prior to its onset:
  * Predicting heart failure
  * Predict sepsis prior to its onset
